# AutoMarket

A repository for final project. It is an application (AutoMarket) for buying, selling and swapping used vehicles. Users create an account to put up listings. Listings are created by filling out a form with a wide variety of characteristics to choose from, such as the make, model, mileage, color, fuel type, and transmission. The listings include a contact form that potential buyers can use to reach the seller. The app will be created with Node.js in Visual Studio Code, pgAdmin, and Bootstrap Studio.
